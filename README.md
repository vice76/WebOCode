# Project : Sanjeevni

# Inspiration : 
We all know that during the covid second wave , we were all in need of medicines and medical equipments. Each day the number of cases were increasing and more people needed oxygen, plasma, medicines, injections like remdesivir, it was very hard to find beds, ventilators, oxygen, plasma and the number of medicines . <br>
Also, there is a huge demand for plasma donation in every hospital, and thus to save life of others we came across this idea.
<br>
Also, in this pandemic after seeing the news we get more frustrated ,so to keep yourself update with covid data you can check in this website.
<br>

# What it does : 
Sanjeevni is a initiative to help people by providing them a platform to find the availability of medicines, injections , plasma and oxygen in their city. We also request people if they have any valid resource of medical needs mentioned above can put them up. Your one help can save millions life. Stay safe , Stay healthy.  <br>
People can also volunteer themselves for plasma donation <br>
On the other hand, you can also register for vaccination through our website and also have a knowledege of updated cases of India.<br>

# How we built it
